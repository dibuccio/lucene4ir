\subsection{Challenges and Opportunities}


\todo{Some challenges from charlie}
- lack of good real-world test data for researchers. Companies need to provide this
- many open source search companies are small and therefore find it hard to support apprenticeships, internships etc. or access funding such as KTPs
- Lucene community can be hard to enter - learning curve can be steep, this is a very large and complex project
