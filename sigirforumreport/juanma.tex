\subsection*{Using Lucene for Teaching and Learning IR: The 
University of Granada case of study ?} 
{\bf  Prof. Juan Manual Fernandez Luna (University of Granda) }:
In this talk, we shall describe how the University of Granada is 
supporting teaching and learning Information Retrieval (TLIR) discipline 
across different courses in the Computer Science studies (degree and 
masters), and how this is done by means of the Lucene API. Later we 
shall present our thoughts about how Lucene could be used inTLIR context 
and present some proposals for improving the Lucene experience, both for 
students and lecturers.
